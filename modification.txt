1. initializeBMSIDs()
Purpose:
Assigns unique IDs to all BMS modules during system initialization. It ensures that each module has a valid and distinct ID.

Functionality:

Iterates through all modules (default: 10 modules).
Checks the stored ID in the EEPROM for each module.
If an ID is missing (set to 0) or invalid (greater than 100), a new ID is assigned.
Newly assigned IDs are incremented sequentially starting from 1 (lastID).
Updates the EEPROM with the new IDs and ensures the changes are committed.
Example Behavior:

Module 1 has no ID stored (value = 0). Assigns ID 1.
Module 2 has ID 55. Keeps it as-is.
Module 3 has an invalid ID (255). Assigns ID 2.
2. assignMaster()
Purpose:
Identifies and assigns the master BMS module based on the lowest module ID.

Functionality:

Reads all stored IDs from the EEPROM.
Determines the module with the smallest ID.
Logs the ID of the master module.
Use Case:

The master module acts as the coordinator and manages communication with other BMS modules and external systems like the Victron Cerbo GX.
3. checkDuplicateIDs()
Purpose:
Detects and resolves duplicate IDs among BMS modules to ensure unique identification.

Functionality:

Compares the stored IDs of all modules.
If a duplicate ID is detected:
Assigns a new unique ID to the conflicting module using lastID.
Updates the EEPROM with the new ID and commits the changes.
Logs a warning whenever a duplicate ID is corrected.
Example Behavior:

Module 1 and Module 3 both have ID 5.
Module 3 is reassigned a new ID, e.g., 11.
4. setupCANCommunication()
Purpose:
Initializes the CAN communication system for data exchange between BMS modules and the master module.

Functionality:

Configures the CAN driver with default settings:
GPIO pins for CAN RX and TX.
Bit rate set to 125 Kbps.
Accepts all incoming messages (no filters applied).
Starts the CAN driver.
Use Case:

Sets up the CAN bus to facilitate communication between BMS modules and external systems like Victron Cerbo GX.
5. processIncomingCANMessages()
Purpose:
Processes incoming CAN messages received by the system.

Functionality:

Listens for messages on the CAN bus.
Logs the details of each received message:
Message ID.
Data length.
Can be expanded to handle specific message types or respond to requests.
Example Behavior:

Receives a message with ID 0x100 and length 8. Logs the information.
Summary of the New Features
Automatic ID Assignment:

Ensures all modules have unique and valid IDs.
Master-Slave Architecture:

Assigns a master module based on the smallest ID.
Duplicate ID Resolution:

Detects and resolves conflicting IDs automatically.
CAN Communication Setup:

Configures the CAN bus for seamless communication between modules.
CAN Message Processing:

Handles incoming CAN messages, enabling integration with external systems like Victron devices.
These features collectively enhance the robustness and functionality of the BMS system, ensuring reliable operation and efficient communication in a multi-module environment.
